# 📊 SPSS Analysis: Economic Shocks & Education in India During COVID-19

## 📌 Project Overview
This data analytics project uses **SPSS** to examine how pandemic-induced economic fluctuations impacted India's education system through hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and policy evaluation.

**Period:** 2018–2021 | **Data Sources:** World Bank, RBI, UDISE+, TRAI

## 🔬 Hypotheses Tested
| Hypothesis | Description | Result |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **H₁: Fiscal Prioritization** | Education expenditure decreases during economic contraction | ❌ Rejected – funding remained stable |
| **H₂: Economic Primacy** | State income predicts dropout rates | ✅ Supported (B = -2.097, p = .005) |
| **H₃: Pandemic Impact** | Dropout rates differ pre/post-pandemic | ✅ Supported (4.29 pp reduction, p = .001) |

## 📈 Key Findings
1. **Fiscal Resilience:** Education expenditure remained stable (4.16% of GDP) despite -5.78% GDP contraction.
2. **Economic Determinant:** State per capita income is a strong predictor of dropout rates (2.1 pp decrease per ₹100,000 increase).
3. **Pandemic Paradox:** Dropout rates decreased post-pandemic by 4.29 percentage points (p = .001).
4. **Digital Context:** Internet access became a significant correlate only during crisis periods.
